# Libraries

This directory collects libraries used elsehwere in this repo. For all those libraries, the version here is the canonical copy. Every library has an associated example and test notebook called `XXX_Test.ipynb` and the associated JupyText `.py` file


## Contained libraries

- `BlackScholesLib.py`: a simple library calculating option prices using BlackScholes
- `AMMGammaLib.py`: calculations around AMM Gamma
- `RPathLib.py`: random path generation

## Testing

The testing code is in `ConvertNBTest.ipynb` and the associated JupyText `.py` file. It requires the `fls.py` library code that does not have its canonical location here.
